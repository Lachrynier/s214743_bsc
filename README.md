# Computational Methods for Correcting Metal-Induced Reconstruction Artifacts in X-ray CT of Historic Gold Treasure

Author: David Diamond Wang Johansen (s214743)

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code developed for my BSc thesis, completed in the fall semester of 2024. The focus of the thesis is on computational methods for correcting metal-induced reconstruction artifacts in X-ray computed tomography (CT) of historic gold treasure.

**Note:** Not all notebooks and intermediary investigations that were part of the process are included in this repository.

## Dataset Information

The Vindelev dataset is currently being prepared for a DOI. For inquiries related to the dataset, please contact:

- Carsten Gundlach: [cagu@fysik.dtu.dk](mailto:cagu@fysik.dtu.dk)
- Hans Martin Kjer: [hmkj@dtu.dk](mailto:hmkj@dtu.dk)

It is assumed that all the center slice data with COR corrections are saved under the `centres/` directory as `AcquisitionData` objects in pickle data format.

## Environment Setup

The Python virtual environment used for this project is `conda`. All the required channels, packages, and dependencies are listed in the `requirements.yml` file.

## Repository Structure

### `core.py`

This file contains the major functions and classes used throughout the project, including those required by `plotting.py`.

### `plotting.py`

This file contains the code to generate the majority of the plots, primarily related to 2D reconstructions, for the report.

### `notebooks/`

This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks used for some of the processing and for the 3D plotting.
